# Coffee Shop Domain Model

This project is a Python application that models a Coffee Shop domain using object-oriented programming principles. It includes three main entities: `Customer`, `Coffee`, and `Order`, with defined relationships and methods to manage orders and track customer coffee purchases.

## Project Structure
- `customer.py`: Contains the `Customer` class.
- `coffee.py`: Contains the `Coffee` class.
- `order.py`: Contains the `Order` class.
- `debug.py`: Interactive script for testing the application.
- `tests/`: Directory containing test files (`test_customer.py`, `test_coffee.py`, `test_order.py`).
- `Pipfile`: Manages dependencies using `pipenv`.
